# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [5.3.0] - 2025-07-18

### Added

- `getAnimationTime` which returns how long an animation has been running for

## [5.2.0] - 2025-07-17

### Added

- getCubicBezier2D - for creating beziers with 2D control points.

## [4.11.0] - 2024-10-30

### Changed

- Made animatable objects support any root node that is not an object along with supporting functions. Any root node that is not of type `number` will be treated the same as strings are treated. In the future I might add support for bigint interpolation, but currently bigint is treated the same as strings.

## [4.10.0] - 2024-10-29

### Changed

- Made animatable objects support strings. Strings will instantly snap to the new value once the animation is at least halfway done. (see documentation for `getStateTree`)

## [4.9.0] - 2024-10-20

### Added

- Created a new event, `immutableStart`, which by convention will only be consumed when the listener does not modify any animation state and instead only updates metadata, such as with proxies.

## [4.8.1] - 2024-10-18

### Fixed

- Made sure to actually export the type definition added in 4.8.0.

## [4.8.0] - 2024-10-18

### Added

- Type definition for suppressing listeners on`modifyTo` calls.

## [4.7.0] - 2024-10-11

### Changed

- Changed definition of the `Mount` function to also take an optional options parameter.

## [4.6.0] - 2024-10-10

### Added

- Support for the AbortSignal to remove event listeners from an object.

## [4.5.0] - 2024-09-07

### Added

- The ability to just change interpolation function locally.

## [4.4.0] - 2024-09-01

### Added

- The ability to suppress start and interrupt listeners within a modifyTo call via the suppressListeners parameter.

### Fixed

- Edge case involving children (see [tests/childEdges.test.ts](tests/childEdges.test.ts))

## [4.3.0] - 2024-08-22

### Added

- Added `suppressListeners` as an argument to modifyTo

## [4.2.2] - 2024-08-11

### Fixed

## [4.2.1] - 2024-08-08

### Fixed

## [4.1.0] - 2024-08-08

### Fixed

## [3.0.0] - 2024-07-13

### Changed

- Moved bounds from the main library into an extension.
  - How to refactor:

```diff
+ const { unsub: unsubBounds, update: updateBounds } = initializeBounds(anim, {})
- boundAnimation(anim, {
+ updateBounds({
    x: 0
})
```

### Added

- Extensions
- ExtensionStack
  - Lets you hot swap between behavior configurations
